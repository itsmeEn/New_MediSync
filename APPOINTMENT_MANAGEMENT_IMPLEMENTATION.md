# Appointment Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive appointment management system with support for scheduling, rescheduling, cancellation, and duplicate prevention.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Models (`backend/operations/models.py`)
- **Added new status**: `"rescheduled"` to the appointment status choices
- **New fields**:
  - `cancellation_reason`: TextField to store the reason for cancellation
  - `reschedule_reason`: TextField to store the reason for rescheduling

#### Serializers (`backend/operations/serializers.py`)
- **Enhanced AppointmentSerializer**:
  - Added `doctor_id`: ID of the assigned doctor
  - Added `department`: Department/specialization of the doctor
  - Added `type`: User-friendly appointment type
  - Added `reason`: Default reason for display
  - Added `cancellation_reason`: Reason for cancellation
  - Added `reschedule_reason`: Reason for rescheduling

#### Views (`backend/operations/views.py`)
- **New Endpoints**:
  1. `reschedule_appointment(appointment_id)`: PATCH endpoint to reschedule appointments
     - Updates appointment date, time, and status to "rescheduled"
     - Validates user ownership of the appointment
     - Notifies the doctor about the reschedule
  
  2. `cancel_appointment(appointment_id)`: PATCH endpoint to cancel appointments
     - Updates status to "cancelled" and stores cancellation reason
     - Validates user ownership of the appointment
     - Notifies the doctor about the cancellation
  
  3. `patient_appointments()`: GET endpoint to fetch all patient appointments
     - Returns all appointments for the logged-in patient
     - Supports filtering by status

#### URLs (`backend/operations/urls.py`)
- **New Routes**:
  - `/operations/appointments/<id>/reschedule/` - Reschedule appointment
  - `/operations/appointments/<id>/cancel/` - Cancel appointment
  - `/operations/patient/appointments/` - Get patient appointments

#### Database Migration
- Created migration: `0010_add_reschedule_cancel_fields.py`
  - Adds `cancellation_reason` and `reschedule_reason` fields
  - Updates status field to include "rescheduled" option

### 2. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/pages/PatientAppointmentSchedule.vue`)

#### New State Management
- **Added**: `rescheduleAppointmentId` to track which appointment is being rescheduled
- This enables proper duplicate checking by excluding the current appointment

#### Enhanced Functions

##### `checkForDuplicateAppointment()`
- **Improved logic**:
  - Fetches all patient appointments
  - Filters out cancelled appointments
  - Excludes the current appointment being rescheduled
  - Compares dates and times to detect duplicates
  - Shows warning modal if duplicate detected

##### `onSubmit()`
- **Reschedule support**:
  - Checks if operation is a reschedule or new appointment
  - Calls appropriate endpoint (PATCH for reschedule, POST for new)
  - Updates appointment status to "rescheduled" when rescheduling
  - Includes reschedule reason in the payload

##### `rescheduleAppointment()` & `rescheduleFromCancel()`
- **Enhanced**:
  - Sets `rescheduleAppointmentId` to track the appointment being modified
  - Pre-fills form with existing appointment data
  - Enables proper duplicate detection

##### `closeScheduleForm()`
- **Updated**:
  - Resets `rescheduleAppointmentId` to null
  - Clears all form data

##### `loadAppointments()`
- **Updated**:
  - Uses new patient-specific endpoint `/operations/patient/appointments/`

##### `validateDate()`
- **Fixed**:
  - Added proper null checking to prevent TypeScript errors
  - Validates date parts before creating Date object

## Features Implemented

### 1. Appointment Management Sections
✅ **Scheduled Appointments**: Displays all successfully booked appointments with status "scheduled"
✅ **Rescheduled Appointments**: Shows appointments that have been modified with status "rescheduled"
✅ **Cancelled Appointments**: Maintains a record of canceled appointments with status "cancelled"

### 2. Cancellation Workflow
✅ **Cancel Button**: Each scheduled appointment has a cancel option
✅ **Confirmation Modal**: Before cancellation, displays a modal with:
   - Appointment details preview
   - Optional cancellation reason input
   - Three action buttons:
     * "Keep Appointment" - Closes modal without changes
     * "Reschedule Instead" - Opens reschedule form
     * "Confirm Cancellation" - Proceeds with cancellation

### 3. Duplicate Appointment Prevention
✅ **Validation**: Checks for duplicate appointments before scheduling/rescheduling
✅ **Warning Message**: Shows "This time slot is not available. Please choose another time."
✅ **Smart Checking**: 
   - Excludes cancelled appointments
   - Excludes the appointment being rescheduled
   - Compares both date and time

### 4. UI Requirements
✅ **Clear Separation**: Three distinct tabs for different appointment statuses
✅ **Intuitive Design**: 
   - Color-coded badges (Green for scheduled, Orange for rescheduled, Grey for cancelled)
   - Clear action buttons
   - Visual feedback with icons
✅ **Responsive Design**: 
   - Grid layout adapts to screen size
   - Mobile-friendly bottom navigation
   - Works on all device sizes

### 5. State Management
✅ **Status Tracking**: Appointments automatically move between sections based on status
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately after actions
✅ **Search Functionality**: Filter appointments by doctor name, department, or type
✅ **Computed Properties**: Separate computed properties for each appointment type

## User Flow

### Scheduling a New Appointment
1. Patient clicks "BOOK NOW" button
2. Fills out appointment form (type, department, doctor, date, time, reason)
3. System checks for duplicate appointments
4. If no duplicate: Appointment is created with status "scheduled"
5. Doctor receives notification
6. Appointment appears in "UPCOMING" tab

### Rescheduling an Appointment
1. Patient navigates to appointment card
2. Clicks "Reschedule" button
3. Form pre-fills with existing appointment data
4. Patient updates date/time as needed
5. System checks for conflicts (excluding current appointment)
6. If no conflict: Appointment is updated with status "rescheduled"
7. Doctor receives notification
8. Appointment moves to "RESCHEDULED" tab

### Cancelling an Appointment
1. Patient clicks "Cancel" button on appointment card
2. Confirmation modal appears with appointment details
3. Patient has three options:
   - Keep appointment (no action)
   - Reschedule instead (opens reschedule form)
   - Confirm cancellation (proceeds with cancellation)
4. If confirmed: Status changes to "cancelled"
5. Doctor receives notification
6. Appointment moves to "CANCELLED" tab
7. Patient can still reschedule from cancelled tab

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Schedule a new appointment
- [ ] Verify appointment appears in UPCOMING tab
- [ ] Reschedule the appointment to a different time
- [ ] Verify it moves to RESCHEDULED tab
- [ ] Try to schedule another appointment at the same time (should show warning)
- [ ] Cancel an appointment
- [ ] Verify it moves to CANCELLED tab
- [ ] Try to reschedule from cancel modal
- [ ] Search for appointments by doctor name
- [ ] Search for appointments by department
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify notifications are sent to doctor

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Scheduling appointment in the past (should fail)
- [ ] Rescheduling to the past (should fail)
- [ ] Multiple appointments with same doctor but different times
- [ ] Rescheduling to a time slot that's already taken
- [ ] Cancelling an already cancelled appointment
- [ ] Network errors during operations

## Security Considerations
- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Users can only access their own appointments
- ✅ Appointment ownership verified before any modifications
- ✅ Input validation on all fields
- ✅ Date/time validation to prevent past appointments

## Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Computed properties for efficient filtering
- ✅ Single API call to load all appointments
- ✅ Client-side search for instant results
- ✅ Lazy loading of doctor options

## Future Enhancements
- Add appointment reminders (SMS/Email)
- Implement recurring appointments
- Add video consultation support
- Enable appointment sharing with family members
- Add appointment history export
- Implement appointment analytics dashboard
- Add waitlist functionality for fully booked slots
- Support for multi-day appointments
- Integration with calendar apps (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar)

## Known Limitations
- Appointments cannot be edited after they're completed
- Past appointments cannot be rescheduled
- No batch operations (cancel/reschedule multiple appointments)
- No appointment templates for recurring visits

## Conclusion
The appointment management system is now fully functional with comprehensive support for scheduling, rescheduling, cancellation, and duplicate prevention. All requested features have been implemented with proper error handling, validation, and user feedback.
