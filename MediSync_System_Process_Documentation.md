    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        layers.Dropout(0.3),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dropout(0.2),
        layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')  # 3 risk categories
    ])
```

**Architecture Details**:
- **Input Layer**: Variable size based on feature extraction
- **Hidden Layers**: 128 → 64 → 32 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Dropout**: 30% and 20% for regularization

```python
self.rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=10,
    random_state=RANDOM_SEED
)
```

**Configuration**:

    # Seasonal illness patterns
    # Risk-correlated outcomes
    # Statistical consistency
```

**Data Characteristics**:
- **Demographics**: Realistic age and gender distributions
- **Conditions**: Common medical conditions with seasonal variations
- **Risk Correlation**: Higher risk demographics correlate with increased illness rates
